***acknowledgment***

This is my acknowledgement towards all the people who helped me create these documents, which were all part of my learning process, I was lucky to learn with some great instructors through online courses "Colt Steel on Udemy" and YouTube tutorials "Programming with Mosh" and finally at "Code Immersives NYC" excellent program and instructors, I wouldn't have learned coding without them!


I hope you can find these files helpful to you in your endeavors.


Thanks,

Mounir Benabderrahmane.
