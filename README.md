***acknowledgment***

This is my acknowledgement towards all the people who helped me create these documents, which were all part of my learning process, I was lucky to learn with some great instructors from online courses to YouTube tutorials and finally at "Code Immersives NYC" excellent program and instructors, I wouldn't have learned to code without them!


I hope you can find these files helpful to you in your endeavors.


Thanks,

Mounir Benabderrahmane.
